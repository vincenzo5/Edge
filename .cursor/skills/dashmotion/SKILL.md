description: Create dark-themed, animated technical diagrams as self-contained HTML+SVG files — flowcharts whose connectors visibly flow, and architecture diagrams where requests travel as light dots through the system (Diagrid/Temporal landing-page style). Use this skill whenever the user asks for a flowchart, workflow, pipeline, process diagram, state machine, system architecture, infrastructure, cloud, microservices, or network topology diagram — and especially when they mention "animated", "flowing", "dynamic", "alive", "GIF-like", or want a diagram for a landing page, README, docs, or product demo. Prefer this over static diagram output whenever the diagram represents anything that moves: requests, events, data, jobs, messages, or control flow.

# Dashmotion

Create professional animated technical diagrams as single self-contained HTML files. The name is the implementation: `stroke-dashoffset` animation + `animateMotion` — that's all there is. Output is vector, loops forever, weighs a few KB, and opens in any browser.

## Step 1 — Pick the mode

| User wants | Mode | Read |
|---|---|---|
| Steps, sequence, branching, parallel execution, state transitions ("what happens, in what order") | **Flow** | `references/flow-mode.md` |
| Components, services, infrastructure, containment, topology (" what the system is made of") | **Architecture** | `references/architecture-mode.md` |

Mixed request ("show our microservices AND how an order flows through them") → Architecture mode; the animated request path *is* the flow. Only produce two separate files if the process has branching logic that the topology can't express.

**Read the mode reference file before writing any coordinates.** Each contains the layout arithmetic that prevents the common failures (overlaps, arrows through boxes, broken loops).

## Step 2 — The two animation contracts (both modes)

### Flowing dashed connectors — `stroke-dashoffset`

```css
.flow { stroke-dasharray: 5 5; animation: dashmove 0.75s linear infinite; }
@keyframes dashmove { to { stroke-dashoffset: -10; } }
```

- The offset delta MUST equal one full `stroke-dasharray` period (here 5+5=10), or the loop visibly jumps.
- Negative offset flows in the path's drawing direction → **always author connector `d` from source to target.**
- 0.6–0.9s reads as "electric current"; slower than 1.5s reads as broken.

### Traveling dots — `animateMotion`

```svg
<circle r="3.5" class="dot" fill="#34d399">
  <animateMotion dur="2s" repeatCount="indefinite"
    path="M400 178 L400 204 L170 204 L170 222"/>
</circle>
```

- `path` reuses the connector's `d` verbatim; the dot rides exactly on the line.
- The circle has no `cx`/`cy` — `animateMotion` positions it.
- Stagger with `begin="0.7s"` etc. 3–6 dots total per diagram; put them where direction is informative (fan-outs, merges, the main request path), never on every edge.
- In Architecture mode a dot is semantically **a request/message in flight** — route dots along realistic end-to-end journeys.

## Step 3 — Shared design tokens

- Page: `#020617`, 40px grid pattern (`#0f1b33`, 0.5px lines), JetBrains Mono via Google Fonts.
- Text: labels `#e2e8f0` 13px/500, sublabels `#64748b` 10px, legend 11px.
- Node corner `rx="8"`; START/END pills `rx` = height/2.
- One shared arrowhead marker using `context-stroke` (inherits each line's color):

```svg
<marker id="arrow" viewBox="0 0 10 10" refX="8" refY="5" markerWidth="6" markerHeight="6" orient="auto-start-reverse">
  <path d="M2 1L8 5L2 9" fill="none" stroke="context-stroke" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/>
</marker>
```

- Connector endpoints stop **4px short** of node edges so arrowheads don't pierce borders.
- **Every connector `<path>` MUST have `fill="none"`** — SVG defaults to black fill and an L-shaped path renders as a giant black polygon without it.
- Z-order paint sequence: grid → connectors → dots → nodes. Nodes mask line ends; dots vanish "into" nodes instead of sliding over them.
- ViewBox: `0 0 W H` where H = lowest element bottom + 50. Never negative coordinates.

## Edge-Specific Color Overrides

When generating diagrams for the Edge landing page, override the default design tokens:

- Page background: `#0A0B0E` (Deep Dark)
- Surface nodes: `#12131A` (Dark Gray)
- Borders: `#1E2030` (Subtle Gray)
- Accent / dots: `#00FF88` (Electric Green)
- Text primary: `#E8E9ED` (Near White)
- Text secondary: `#8B8FA3` (Cool Gray)
- Font: Space Grotesk (display), DM Sans (labels)

## Step 4 — Accessibility & motion (non-negotiable)

- Wrap ALL CSS animation in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`.
- SMIL ignores that media query → keep the template's inline script that removes `.dot` elements under reduced motion and wires the visible ⏯ pause toggle (`animation-play-state: paused` + `svg.pauseAnimations()`).
- SVG gets `role="img"` + `aria-label` + `aria-description`.

## Step 5 — Produce the file

1. Parse the description into nodes (typed), edges (directed), groups/boundaries.
2. Do the layout arithmetic from the mode reference explicitly before writing coordinates.
3. Copy the mode's template; replace SVG content, title, header, legend, summary cards. Keep CSS, pause toggle, and reduced-motion script intact.
4. Pick 3–6 dot paths, copy connector `d` values, stagger `begin`.
5. Save as `<name>-dashmotion.html`. Tell the user it opens directly in any browser.

### GIF/MP4 export (only if asked)

Never render frames by hand. Screen-record the open file (macOS ⌘⇧5), or headless:
`npx timecut <file.html> --viewport=1200,900 --duration=3 --fps=30 --output=flow.mp4` then `ffmpeg -i flow.mp4 flow.gif`.
A 3s capture loops seamlessly when all durations divide 3s — prefer 0.75s / 1.5s / 3s when GIF export is the goal.

## Step 6 — Structural self-check (before delivering)

Hand-computed coordinates fail in predictable ways. The file is not done when it's written — it's done when it passes this checklist. Re-read the SVG you just produced and verify each item **with arithmetic on the actual numbers**, not by eyeballing the code. Fix every violation and re-check until the list is clean.

1. **Overlaps** — for every pair of same-row elements: `left.x + left.width + gap ≤ right.x` (gap ≥ 20 flow / 40 architecture). For every stacked pair: `top.y + top.height + gap ≤ bottom.y`.
2. **Connectors through boxes** — walk every path segment by segment: between its endpoints it must not enter any node rect.
3. **Animation loops** — for each animated class: `|stroke-dashoffset delta|` must be an exact multiple of the `stroke-dasharray` period sum. Every `begin="X.end+…"` must reference an `id` that exists.
4. **ViewBox bounds** — no negative coordinates; every coordinate stays inside `0 0 W H`.
5. **Connector & markup hygiene** — every connector `<path>` resolves to `fill="none"`; endpoints stop ~4px short of target border.

Deliver the file only after a pass where nothing needed fixing.

## Output contract

One self-contained `.html`: embedded CSS, inline SVG, no external assets except Google Fonts, no JS dependencies. Renders correctly opened from the filesystem.
